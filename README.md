# Pleb-Cluster
The goal of this project is to create an open-source platform for training machine learning models using a decentralized cluster of otherwise idle devices. By leveraging the power of idle devices, we can create a more sustainable and cost-effective way of training AI models, while also reducing the reliance on centralized cloud providers.

The benefits of a decentralized cluster for distributed AI model training are numerous:

Lower costs: By using idle devices, we can significantly reduce the cost of AI model training, as we don't need to pay for expensive cloud computing resources.
Improved sustainability: By utilizing idle devices, we can make better use of existing resources and reduce the need for new hardware, leading to a more sustainable approach to AI model training.
Decreased reliance on Cloud providers: By decentralizing the training process, we can improve the privacy of AI model training by reducing the reliance on centralized cloud providers.
Architecture
The architecture of the Decentralized Cluster for Distributed AI Model Training is based on a peer-to-peer network of devices that collaborate to train machine learning models. The architecture is composed of the following components:

Master node: The master node coordinates the training process and distributes the data and models to the worker nodes. The master node also handles the aggregation of model updates from the worker nodes.
Worker nodes: The worker nodes receive data and models from the master node, train the models on their local hardware, and send the updates back to the master node for aggregation.
Load balancer: The load balancer distributes the workload evenly across the worker nodes to ensure efficient use of resources.
Data storage: The data storage component stores the training data and models, and ensures that the data is distributed evenly across the worker nodes.
Here's an example of what the architecture might look like:

Challenges
Building and using a decentralized cluster for distributed AI model training comes with its own set of challenges:

Data privacy and security: Since data is distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring the privacy and security of the data becomes more challenging.
Network latency: Since the nodes in the cluster are likely spread out geographically, network latency can become a bottleneck, especially for larger models and datasets.
Node reliability: Since the nodes in the cluster are typically idle devices, there is a risk that some nodes may fail or become unavailable during the training process. This means that the system needs to be designed to handle node failures and ensure that the training process can continue even if some nodes are offline.
Resource heterogeneity: Since the nodes in the cluster are likely to have different hardware specifications, it can be challenging to balance the workload across the nodes and ensure that the training process is efficient.
